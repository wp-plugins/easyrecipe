Adding a recipe to a Wordpress blog is now quick, easy AND provides the recipe microformatting that Google is looking for.

== Description ==

Since Google introduced [Recipe View](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/slice-and-dice-your-recipe-search.html), food bloggers became aware that their recipes needed microformatting or they'd lose visitors to sites who supplied this information to Google. Bloggers who do not use rich snippets for their recipes won't be able to be shown in Recipe View searches on Google.

Adding rich snippet microformatting to a post is not only time consuming but it's also pretty geeky and most cooks prefer to cook not code webpages.

Enter EasyRecipe.

Our EasyRecipe plugin gives you all the advantages of microformats, without any of the messy coding. We've done all the geeky work for you.  

Enter your post, enter your photos and enter your recipe.  EasyRecipe formats it all and allows your visitors to view your nicely formatted recipe AND print it along with a thumbnail photo.

It's quick. It's easy. The recipes look good.  They offer ratings and print features and most importantly you have a much better chance for your recipes showing up in Google's Recipe View search results.

== Installation ==

You can download and install the EasyRecipe plugin using the built in WordPress plugin installer. If you download the EasyRecipe plugin manually, just upload it to your Wordpress plugins directory and unzip it.

Activate the EasyRecipe plugin in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link.

To use the plugin, click the Easy Recipe button (the chef icon) on the "Add Post" or "Edit Post" pages, right next to the editor formatting buttons. Then enter (or cut and paste) your recipe into EasyRecipe.  Any ingredient or instruction line beginning with an exclamation mark (!) is formatted as a heading. Click the "Add Recipe" button and it will save your recipe and insert it into your blog post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do you put a placeholder into my Edit Post page, instead of the actual recipe? =

Because of the way the WordPress editor works, if you make changes to your recipe using the html editor, you're at risk of messing up the microformatting and then you'll be upset with us.  We want you to show up in Google so EasyRecipe requires that you make changes by clicking the placeholder and changing your previous entry.

= Why Is EasyRecipe Better? =

Because not only is EasyRecipe an easy way to let the search engines get your recipes in the format that helps you get the most exposure for your recipes, it really IS easy to use.  Simply cut and paste your recipe in Easy Recipe and hit publish. The options on our EasyRecipe screen are the ones Google looks for.

= How can I request a feature to be added in future versions of EasyRecipe Plugin? =

You can [contact us](http://orgasmicchef.com/easyrecipe/support/) with your requests.  We may not be able to implement every request, but we want to make this the easiest recipe plugin for everyone to use.

= Can You Convert Your Recipes From Plain Text or Another Plugin? =

We CAN but it all depends on what's in the text and/or what other things another plugin has added.  We can’t guarantee that you won’t need to do a little additional manual editing, but Easy Recipe can usually do 95% of the work for you.

= Where Can I Get Help? =

We’ll do our best to help you with any problem you have with EasyRecipe.  You can [contact me](http://orgasmicchef.com/easyrecipe/support/) and we’ll answer you as quickly as we can.
